# UX Foundations

This skill provides the core UX knowledge base that underpins all interface design work. It covers four pillars:

1. **Usability Heuristics** -- Nielsen's 10 principles for evaluating any interface
2. **UX Psychology** -- Cognitive laws governing how users perceive, decide, and act
3. **Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)** -- Requirements for inclusive, standards-compliant interfaces
4. **Design System Fundamentals** -- Spacing, typography, color, and layout specifications

Apply these foundations universally -- they hold true for SaaS dashboards, landing pages, admin portals, mobile apps, and any web-based interface.

## Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics (Quick Reference)

| # | Heuristic | Core Rule |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Visibility of system status | Always inform users about what is happening through timely, appropriate feedback. |
| 2 | Match between system and real world | Use language, concepts, and conventions familiar to the user, not internal jargon. |
| 3 | User control and freedom | Provide undo, redo, cancel, and clear exit paths -- users will make mistakes. |
| 4 | Consistency and standards | Follow platform conventions; identical actions must produce identical results everywhere. |
| 5 | Error prevention | Design constraints and confirmations that prevent errors before they occur. |
| 6 | Recognition rather than recall | Make elements, actions, and options visible so users never need to memorize. |
| 7 | Flexibility and efficiency of use | Offer shortcuts and customization for experts without confusing novices. |
| 8 | Aesthetic and minimalist design | Remove every element that does not serve a clear purpose; information competes for attention. |
| 9 | Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors | Write error messages in plain language, identify the problem specifically, and suggest a fix. |
| 10 | Help and documentation | Provide searchable, task-focused help that is easy to find and contextually relevant. |

## Key UX Psychology Laws (Quick Reference)

| Law | Core Rule |
|-----|-----------|
| **Fitts's Law** | Make targets large and close to the user's focus area -- time to reach a target depends on its size and distance. Min touch target: 44x44px (WCAG), 48x48px (Material). |
| **Hick's Law** | Limit choices to reduce decision time -- keep primary navigation to 5-7 items, use progressive disclosure, and break complex decisions into sequential steps. |
| **Miller's Law** | Working memory holds 7 +/- 2 items -- chunk information into groups of 3-4, limit steps in wizards, and use external memory aids. |
| **Cognitive Load Theory** | Minimize extraneous load (visual clutter, inconsistency), simplify intrinsic load (break tasks into steps), and maximize germane load (use familiar patterns to aid learning). |
| **Gestalt Principles** | Users perceive visual groups based on proximity, similarity, closure, continuity, figure-ground, common region, and symmetry -- use these to structure layouts. |
| **Von Restorff Effect** | An item that stands out from its group is more likely to be remembered -- use visual distinction for primary CTAs and critical information. |
| **Jakob's Law** | Users spend most of their time on other sites and expect similar patterns -- follow established conventions rather than reinventing interactions. |

## UX Scoring Rubric (Quick Reference)

Score each dimension from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent). Global score = sum of 10 dimensions (max 100).

| Dimension | 1-3 (Poor) | 4-6 (Adequate) | 7-10 (Excellent) |
|-----------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Navigation** | Users cannot find core features | Users find features with some searching | Users find everything instantly |
| **Clarity** | Users do not understand what to do | Users figure it out with effort | Intent is immediately clear |
| **Feedback** | No response to user actions | Basic loading/success states | Rich, contextual feedback for every action |
| **Error Handling** | Errors cause data loss or dead ends | Errors caught with generic messages | Errors prevented, with specific recovery guidance |
| **Consistency** | Every page feels like a different app | Most patterns are consistent | Complete pattern consistency throughout |
| **Accessibility** | Keyboard unusable, no alt text | Partial WCAG compliance | Full WCAG 2.2 AA compliance |
| **Performance** | LCP > 5s, significant CLS | LCP 2.5-4s, some layout shift | LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, FID < 100ms |
| **Mobile** | Broken on mobile | Functional but awkward on mobile | Native-quality mobile experience |
| **Visual Design** | Cluttered, no hierarchy | Clean with some hierarchy issues | Clear hierarchy, purposeful whitespace, polished |
| **Content** | Jargon-heavy, unclear | Mostly clear, some jargon | Scannable, user-centered, helpful |

- Below 60/100 = Critical attention needed
- 60-80/100 = Solid foundation with room for improvement
- Above 80/100 = Strong UX

When auditing, score each dimension independently and include a 1-sentence justification per score.

## Core Accessibility Requirements (WCAG 2.2 AA)

Apply these four requirements to every interface without exception:

### 1. Color Contrast
- Normal text (under 18px bold or 24px regular): minimum **4.5:1** contrast ratio
- Large text (18px+ bold or 24px+ regular): minimum **3:1** contrast ratio
- Non-text UI elements (icons, borders, form controls): minimum **3:1** contrast ratio
- Never use color as the sole means of conveying information -- always pair with text, icons, or patterns

### 2. Touch and Click Targets
- Minimum target size: **44x44 CSS pixels** (WCAG 2.2), **48x48px** recommended (Material Design)
- Minimum spacing between adjacent targets: **8px**
- Place primary actions in the thumb zone (lower third of mobile screens)

### 3. Keyboard Navigation
- All functionality must be operable via keyboard alone
- Focus indicator must be visible: minimum **2px** outline with **3:1** contrast against adjacent colors
- Focus order must follow logical visual reading order
- No keyboard traps -- users must be able to Tab away from every element
- Provide a skip-navigation link as the first focusable element

### 4. Screen Reader Support
- All images require `alt` text (decorative images use `alt=""`)
- Form inputs must have associated `<label>` elements or `aria-labelledby`
- Dynamic content updates require `aria-live` regions
- Use semantic HTML (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`) as the foundation
- Custom interactive components require appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties

## Design System Essentials

### Spacing Grid (4pt base)
Use multiples of 4px for all spacing, padding, and margin values:
`4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 96`

- Tight (4-8px): icon-to-label gaps, inline element spacing
- Default (12-16px): form label to input, component internal padding
- Loose (24-32px): between components within a section
- Section (48-96px): between major page sections

### Typography Scale
Base size: **16px** body text. Apply a modular scale ratio:

| Ratio Name | Value | Best For |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Major Second | 1.125 | Dense data UIs |
| Minor Third | 1.200 | Text-heavy SaaS interfaces |
| Major Third | 1.250 | General purpose, versatile |
| Perfect Fourth | 1.333 | Marketing and content sites |
| Augmented Fourth | 1.414 | Editorial, blog layouts |
| Perfect Fifth | 1.500 | Presentation-style layouts |
| Golden Ratio | 1.618 | Landing pages, high drama |

Recommended type ramp (px): `12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72`

Limit distinct sizes to 6-8 across the product. Use font weight (regular, medium, semibold, bold) as a secondary hierarchy tool.

### Breakpoints
| Token | Width | Target |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `mobile` | 320px | Small phones |
| `mobile-lg` | 480px | Large phones |
| `tablet` | 768px | Tablets (portrait) |
| `laptop` | 1024px | Small desktops, landscape tablets |
| `desktop` | 1280px | Standard desktops |
| `desktop-lg` | 1440px | Large desktops |
| `wide` | 1920px | Full HD monitors |
