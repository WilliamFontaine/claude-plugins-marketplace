## 1. Headline Formulas

The headline is the single most impactful piece of copy on any landing page. It carries 80% of the communication burden in the hero section and determines whether visitors continue reading or leave.

### PAS: Problem-Agitation-Solution

The most reliable conversion copywriting framework. Works by activating the visitor's pain, intensifying the emotional stakes, then presenting the product as relief.

**Structure**:
1. **Problem**: State the core problem the visitor faces
2. **Agitation**: Amplify the emotional or financial cost of the problem
3. **Solution**: Present the product as the answer

**Example**:
- Problem: "Tired of losing deals because follow-ups fall through the cracks?"
- Agitation: "Every missed follow-up costs your team $3,000 in lost revenue."
- Solution: "Automate your follow-ups and close 40% more deals."

**Application on Landing Pages**:
- The headline captures the Problem
- The subheadline delivers the Agitation
- The CTA area presents the Solution
- The entire hero section works as a compressed PAS sequence

### AIDA: Attention-Interest-Desire-Action

A four-stage framework that maps to the full page flow, not just the headline. Use it to structure the entire landing page narrative.

**Structure**:
1. **Attention**: Grab attention with a bold claim, surprising statistic, or provocative question
2. **Interest**: Build interest with specifics, evidence, and relevance to the visitor's situation
3. **Desire**: Create desire through benefits, social proof, and emotional outcomes
4. **Action**: Drive action with a clear, compelling CTA

**Example (Hero Section)**:
- Attention (headline): "Your team wastes 15 hours every week on manual reporting."
- Interest (subheadline): "We analyzed 500 SaaS teams and found that manual data collection is the #1 productivity killer."
- Desire (social proof teaser): "Join 10,000+ teams that automated their reporting."
- Action (CTA): "Start my free trial"

**Page-Level AIDA Mapping**:
| Stage | Landing Page Section |
|-------|---------------------|
| Attention | Hero headline |
| Interest | Problem statement, feature sections |
| Desire | Social proof, testimonials, case studies |
| Action | CTA (hero, mid-page, footer) |

### 4U Formula for Headlines

Use this formula as a quality checklist for every headline. Score each U on a 1-4 scale; aim for a total score of 12 or higher.

| U | Question | Weak Example | Strong Example |
|---|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Useful** | Does it promise a clear benefit? | "Our Platform" | "Save 10 hours per week" |
| **Urgent** | Is there a reason to act now? | "Check it out" | "Before your next sprint starts" |
| **Unique** | Does it differentiate? | "Project management tool" | "The only PM tool built for remote teams" |
| **Ultra-specific** | Does it include concrete details? | "Improve your workflow" | "Cut meeting time by 40% in 2 weeks" |

**Scoring**: Rate each U from 1 (absent) to 4 (strongly present). Total score:
- 14-16: Exceptional headline
- 10-13: Solid headline
- Below 10: Rewrite recommended

### Additional Headline Patterns

| Pattern | Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **How-to** | "How to [achieve outcome] without [pain point]" | "How to scale your team without losing culture" |
| **Number** | "[Number] ways to [achieve outcome]" | "3 ways to reduce customer churn this quarter" |
| **Question** | "Are you still [doing painful thing]?" | "Are you still tracking projects in spreadsheets?" |
| **Negative** | "Stop [painful action]. Start [better action]." | "Stop guessing. Start measuring." |
| **Social proof** | "Why [number] [audience] switched to [product]" | "Why 5,000 startups switched to [Product]" |
| **Contrast** | "[Old way] vs. [new way]" | "Manual reports vs. real-time dashboards" |

### Headline Audit Checklist

- [ ] Headline is 6-12 words
- [ ] Headline communicates a clear user benefit (not a product feature)
- [ ] Headline avoids jargon, buzzwords, and vague business language
- [ ] Headline passes the "stranger test" (someone unfamiliar can explain what the product does)
- [ ] Headline addresses the visitor's pain point or desired outcome directly
- [ ] Headline scores 10+ on the 4U formula (Useful, Urgent, Unique, Ultra-specific)
- [ ] Subheadline expands on the headline with specifics (quantifiable claim, supporting detail)
- [ ] Headline and subheadline together answer: What is this? Why should I care?

## 2. Value Proposition Frameworks

A value proposition is the core promise that differentiates the product. It must be communicated within the first viewport and reinforced throughout the page.

### The Value Proposition Canvas (Strategyzer)

Map the product's value to the customer's world:

| Customer Side | Product Side |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Jobs**: Tasks the customer needs to accomplish | **Products/Services**: What the product offers |
| **Pains**: Frustrations, risks, and obstacles | **Pain Relievers**: How the product eliminates pains |
| **Gains**: Desired outcomes and benefits | **Gain Creators**: How the product delivers outcomes |

**Application**: The headline addresses the top Job. The subheadline addresses the top Pain. The CTA offers the top Gain Creator.

### XYZ Value Proposition Template

"We help [target audience] [achieve outcome] by [mechanism], so they can [ultimate benefit]."

**Examples**:
- "We help remote teams stay aligned by centralizing project communication, so they ship faster with fewer meetings."
- "We help SaaS companies reduce churn by identifying at-risk accounts early, so they retain more revenue every quarter."

**Rules**:
- Keep the full statement under 30 words
- Focus on one primary audience, one primary outcome, and one primary mechanism
- Test comprehension with someone outside the company

### Before-After-Bridge (BAB)

| Stage | Content | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Before** | Describe the visitor's current painful situation | "Your team spends Monday mornings in status meetings instead of building." |
| **After** | Paint the picture of their world with the problem solved | "Imagine starting every week with a clear dashboard showing every project's status." |
| **Bridge** | Present the product as the bridge between Before and After | "[Product] gives your team real-time project visibility, so meetings become optional." |

### Value Proposition Audit Checklist

- [ ] Value proposition is visible within the first viewport
- [ ] Value proposition clearly states who the product is for (target audience)
- [ ] Value proposition clearly states what outcome the product delivers
- [ ] Value proposition differentiates from alternatives (why this product, not a competitor)
- [ ] Value proposition is under 30 words
- [ ] Value proposition avoids generic claims ("best", "leading", "innovative")
- [ ] Value proposition is reinforced (not just stated once) throughout the page

## 3. Benefit vs. Feature Writing

Features describe what the product does. Benefits describe what the user gains. Benefits convert; features justify. Always lead with the benefit.

### The Feature-to-Benefit Translation

| Feature (What) | Benefit (So What) | Headline Version |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Automated reporting | Save 10 hours per week | "Reclaim your Monday mornings" |
| Real-time collaboration | Ship features faster as a team | "Build together in real time" |
| SSO integration | One click to log in, no passwords to manage | "Log in once, access everything" |
| 99.9% uptime SLA | Never lose access during critical moments | "Always on when you need it" |
| AI-powered search | Find any document in seconds | "Find anything instantly" |
| Customizable dashboards | See exactly the metrics that matter to you | "Your metrics, your way" |

### The "So What?" Test

For every feature listed on the page, ask "So what?" until the answer is a human outcome:

1. "We have automated reporting." -- So what?
2. "You don't have to build reports manually." -- So what?
3. "You save 10 hours per week." -- So what?
4. "You can focus on strategy instead of data entry." -- **This is the benefit. Lead with this.**

### Writing Pattern

**Structure**: Benefit headline + Feature explanation + Evidence

- Headline: "Focus on strategy, not spreadsheets" (benefit)
- Body: "Automated reporting pulls data from 50+ integrations and builds dashboards in seconds." (feature as supporting detail)
- Evidence: Screenshot of the reporting dashboard in action (proof)

### Benefit Writing Audit Checklist

- [ ] Every feature section leads with a benefit-oriented headline
- [ ] The benefit headline describes a user outcome, not a product capability
- [ ] Features are explained as supporting detail below the benefit headline
- [ ] The "So what?" test has been applied to every feature statement
- [ ] Benefits are specific and quantified where possible ("Save 10 hours" not "Save time")
- [ ] No feature is listed without an accompanying user benefit

## 4. Microcopy Patterns

Microcopy is the small text that guides users through interactions: button labels, form labels, placeholder text, tooltips, error messages, and confirmation text. Effective microcopy reduces anxiety, sets expectations, and prevents errors.

### Button Labels

Apply these rules to every button on the landing page:

| Rule | Bad | Good | Why |
|------|-----|------|-----|
| Start with a verb | "Submission" | "Submit application" | Verbs drive action |
| Describe the outcome | "Submit" | "Create my account" | Sets expectations |
| Use first person where appropriate | "Start your trial" | "Start my free trial" | +90% conversion lift |
| Be specific | "Next" | "Continue to payment" | Reduces anxiety about what's next |
| Match the context | "OK" (on a delete dialog) | "Delete project" / "Keep project" | Explicit consequences |
| Reduce risk perception | "Buy now" | "Start free trial" | Lower commitment language |

**CTA Button Copy Formulas**:
- Action + Object: "Download the report"
- Action + Benefit: "Get instant access"
- Action + Object + Qualifier: "Start my free trial -- no credit card"
- First person + Action: "Show me the demo"

### Form Labels and Inputs

| Element | Rule | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Labels** | Always visible above the input (never inside as placeholder-only) | "Email address" (label above input) |
| **Placeholder text** | Use as a format hint, not a replacement for the label | Placeholder: "name@company.com" |
| **Helper text** | Anticipate questions; place below the input | "We'll never share your email. Unsubscribe anytime." |
| **Required fields** | Mark required fields explicitly, or state which fields are optional | "* Required" or "(optional)" on non-required fields |
| **Character counts** | Show for limited-length fields | "42 / 280 characters" |
| **Password fields** | Show requirements upfront and validate in real time | Checklist: 8+ chars, 1 number, 1 uppercase |

### Tooltip and Inline Help Text

- Limit tooltip text to 1-2 sentences
- Trigger on hover (desktop) and tap (mobile) -- never hover-only
- Use tooltips for contextual explanation, not critical instructions
- Place information icons (i) next to labels that might confuse users
- Do not use tooltips as a substitute for clear label writing

### Confirmation and Success Messages

| Context | Bad | Good |
|---------|-----|------|
| Form submission | "Success" | "Your message has been sent. We'll reply within 24 hours." |
| Account creation | "Account created" | "Welcome! Your account is ready. Check your email to verify." |
| Subscription | "Subscribed" | "You're in! Check your inbox for a welcome email from us." |
| File upload | "Upload complete" | "Your file has been uploaded successfully. It will be processed in about 2 minutes." |
| Deletion | (no message) | "Project deleted. Undo (available for 10 seconds)" |

### Microcopy Audit Checklist

- [ ] All buttons start with a verb and describe the action outcome
- [ ] CTA buttons use specific, benefit-oriented language (not "Submit", "OK", or "Click here")
- [ ] Form labels are visible above inputs (not placeholder-only)
- [ ] Placeholder text shows format hints, not label replacements
- [ ] Helper text appears below inputs where users might have questions
- [ ] Required fields are clearly marked
- [ ] Success messages confirm the action and set expectations for what happens next
- [ ] Confirmation messages for destructive actions state the consequences explicitly
- [ ] Tooltip text is 1-2 sentences maximum
- [ ] Terminology is consistent across the page (same thing is always called the same name)

## 5. CTA Copy Formulas

CTA copy directly impacts conversion rates. Apply these research-backed formulas to maximize click-through.

### Primary CTA Formulas

| Formula | Structure | Example | Best For |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Verb + Value** | "[Action] [benefit]" | "Get instant access" | Simple, direct CTAs |
| **First-Person Action** | "[My/me] + [action]" | "Start my free trial" | SaaS sign-ups (+90% lift) |
| **Verb + Object + Qualifier** | "[Action] [thing] -- [reassurance]" | "Download the guide -- it's free" | Lead magnets |
| **Outcome + Time** | "[Result] in [timeframe]" | "Launch in 5 minutes" | Time-sensitive audiences |
| **Risk Reversal** | "[Action] -- [safety net]" | "Try it free for 14 days" | High-commitment products |
| **Social CTA** | "Join [number] [peers]" | "Join 10,000+ marketers" | Community-driven products |

### Supporting CTA Copy (Below the Button)

Place a single line of supporting text directly below the primary CTA button to reduce friction:

| Concern Addressed | Supporting Copy |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Cost anxiety | "No credit card required" |
| Commitment fear | "Cancel anytime -- no questions asked" |
| Risk aversion | "30-day money-back guarantee" |
| Time investment | "Set up in under 5 minutes" |
| Privacy concern | "We never share your data" |
| Trust | "Trusted by 10,000+ companies" |

### Secondary CTA Copy

Secondary CTAs should offer a lower-commitment alternative for visitors not ready to convert on the primary action:

| Primary CTA | Secondary CTA |
|------------|---------------|
| "Start free trial" | "Watch a 2-minute demo" |
| "Get started" | "See pricing" |
| "Create account" | "Read the case study" |
| "Buy now" | "Compare plans" |
| "Schedule a demo" | "Download the whitepaper" |

### CTA Copy Audit Checklist

- [ ] Primary CTA uses a verb-first, benefit-oriented formula
- [ ] Primary CTA uses first-person phrasing where appropriate
- [ ] Supporting text below the CTA addresses the visitor's top objection
- [ ] Secondary CTA offers a lower-commitment alternative
- [ ] CTA copy is specific (not "Submit", "Learn more", or "Click here")
- [ ] CTA copy sets clear expectations for what happens after clicking
- [ ] All CTA instances on the page use consistent copy and styling
- [ ] No CTA uses manipulative language (confirmshaming, fake urgency)

## 6. Error Messages and Form Validation Copy

Error messages on landing page forms directly impact conversion. A confusing or blaming error message causes form abandonment.

### Error Message Structure

Apply this three-part formula to every error message:

1. **What happened**: Describe the issue in plain language
2. **Why it happened**: Provide context (if helpful)
3. **What to do next**: Give a specific corrective action

### Error Message Examples

| Context | Bad | Good |
|---------|-----|------|
| Invalid email | "Invalid input" | "That email address doesn't look right. Check for typos (e.g., name@company.com)." |
| Password too short | "Password invalid" | "Your password needs at least 8 characters." |
| Required field | "Field required" | "Please enter your name to continue." |
| Server error | "Error 500" | "Something went wrong on our end. Please try again in a moment." |
| Payment failed | "Transaction declined" | "Your payment didn't go through. Please check your card details or try a different card." |
| Rate limit | "429 Too Many Requests" | "You've made too many attempts. Please wait a minute and try again." |

### Error Message Rules

- Never blame the user: "That email doesn't look right" not "You entered an invalid email"
- Never expose technical codes: "Something went wrong" not "Error 500: NullPointerException"
- Never use ALL CAPS for error messages
- Always offer a path forward: retry, try differently, contact support
- Show errors inline (next to the relevant field), not in a generic alert banner
- Use real-time validation to catch errors as users type, not only on form submission
- Inline validation reduces form errors by 22% compared to post-submission validation

### Error Message Audit Checklist

- [ ] Every error message follows the What-Why-What structure
- [ ] No technical jargon, error codes, or system messages are exposed to users
- [ ] Error messages never blame the user
- [ ] Error messages suggest a specific corrective action
- [ ] Errors are shown inline next to the relevant field
- [ ] Real-time validation catches errors as users type (not only on submit)
- [ ] Error text uses empathetic, helpful tone
- [ ] A fallback error message exists for unexpected failures ("Something went wrong. Please try again.")
- [ ] Error states are visually distinct (red border, error icon) but not alarming
